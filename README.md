- 👋 Hi, I’m Andrea
- 👀 I’m back-end focused developer interested in scripting languages such as PHP and Python (can't wait to start learning Python)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Laravel and creating RESTful APIs from scratch (no frameworks involved). I'm also dabbling in Git and GitHub. <br>
I realize that, so far, I've only had one (let's say big) project that I've worked on some time ago - it's an e-commerce website that has all the functionalities necessary,
however it was written in procedural coding style which, at the time, was the only thing I knew. I'm very proud of my project even though it lacks a lot - front-end to start with :D <br>
I know how to - I'm no stranger when it comes to JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX and JSON and so on... but I just find talking to servers a lot more fun :) <br>
I've improved since then - I've learned how coding can be cleaner and easier and I'm looking forward to sharing new projects and hearing your thoughts.
Being a self-taught programmer I don't really have anyone in my life who can help me and guide me in a right direction, it's just me and my best friend google. So I make mistakes,
take wrong turns, lose time and efficiency, get stuck... as we all do. So, I think it's time for me to get out of that infamous "pit of despair" and hear your advices, learn more
from the community - we were all begginers once.
